People with generalized anxiety disorder often feel anxious for no apparent reason. They also may feel tired, restless, irritable, short of breath, have difficulty concentrating or sleeping, or have a racing heartbeat. Doctors aren't sure what causes generalized anxiety disorder, but it can run in families. Stressful life situations also may cause the disorder. It can start anytime in life, even in childhood. Medications and psychotherapy, along with lifestyle changes, can help."

Most people experience the same type of seizure from one episode to the next. Petit mal or absence seizures cause staring spells or chewing motions. Partial or focal seizures cause small, repetitive movements from lip smacking to head tilting along with other symptoms such as hallucinations. Generalized tonic-clonic or grand mal seizures cause a person to cry out, fall down, lose consciousness, and have violent muscle contractions, which cause incontinence and convulsions. Epilepsy can affect anyone and usually has no clear cause. Stroke, brain injury, brain illness or infection, brain tumors, birth defects of the brain, certain diseases, and kidney or liver failure can also cause epilepsy. Treatment with anticonvulsive medication, surgery, or vagus nerve stimulation can help people with epilepsy manage their condition.

It can cause people to try to restrict food, exercise obsessively, and maintain a bodyweight that's too low. Anorexia distorts what someone thinks about her body. People with anorexia may be convinced that they are heavy and starve themselves even if they're very underweight. While more common in girls and women, boys and men develop it, too. Triggers for anorexia vary. They include a perfectionist personality, low self-esteem, emotional trauma, societal pressure to be thin, and the influence of popular media. Anorexia is hard to treat. It can be life threatening. It also can lead to complications including heart problems, bone loss, and kidney problems. Therapy and behavior changes can help."

For others, it becomes a lifelong problem. Treatment involves therapy. A therapist helps people understand the problem and change their behaviors. Experts suggest a slow weight gain of 1 pound to 3 pounds a week until someone has reached a normal weight. Family support is crucial. Some people benefit from a stay in the hospital. People who develop anorexia at a young age are more likely to have a full recovery. Even after successful treatment, anorexia can come back."

For example, a child may spend hours counting passing cars or will only talk about trains. Your child will have difficulty with social interaction, and may be rigid and resist change. Your child may be exceptionally skilled in some areas, such as with numbers, math, computers, or music. A child or adolescent psychiatrist can diagnose your child and work with you to develop an effective program to help him or her. There is no specific way to deal with Asperger's syndrome, but most treatment combines psychotherapy, special education, behavior modification, and support for parents. Medication is sometimes recommended. With good, early help, many children are able to cope with disabilities caused by Asperger's syndrome and go on to college and careers.

You may have nausea, vomiting, ringing in your ears, drowsiness, confusion, and rapid breathing. Aspirin poisoning is usually a medical emergency because it can cause unconsciousness or death. It's a common cause of poisoning in children but less so because of child-proof packaging and public education. Intentional aspirin poisoning, such as in an attempted suicide, causes most sudden aspirin poisoning. You can develop gradual poisoning by unknowingly taking a combination of medications that contain aspirin. Activated charcoal, and in severe cases, hemodialysis, are used to treat it. With proper treatment, most people survive."

If you have gradual aspirin poisoning, your symptoms will develop over days or weeks. You may feel drowsy and confused or have hallucinations. Eventually, you could have dehydration, seizures, and brain swelling. For all but the most minor symptoms of aspirin poisoning, you'll need emergency treatment in a hospital. The doctors will give you activated charcoal and intravenous fluids and may pump your stomach (gastric lavage). You may need a ventilator to help you breathe or medications for complications such as seizures. If your condition worsens, you could need dialysis -- a procedure that uses an artificial kidney to filter poisons out of your blood. After emergency treatment, you'll probably be hospitalized for further treatment and monitoring. If the overdose was intentional, you'll see a mental health specialist.

Then the lower chambers contract and pump blood to the rest of the body. With a normal heartbeat, contractions follow in order, and both the upper and lower chambers work at the same pace. With fibrillation, though, the upper chambers beat much faster than the lower ones. So the ventricles don't fill completely and the heart has to work harder to get blood to the rest of the body."

The longer it goes untreated, the more likely you are to notice symptoms of heart failure. These can include shortness of breath, swelling ankles, or a chronic cough with foamy mucus. Strokes are also a potential problem. So you may need to take blood thinners on a regular basis to prevent them.

Lead poisoning may cause trouble sleeping, abdominal cramping, or anemia. Lead can damage almost all parts of the body, and cause problems such as reduced IQ and slowed body growth. Young children are at increased risk for lead poisoning, because their nervous systems are more sensitive to lead.

Lice dig into the skin and feed on blood, causing intense itching and skin irritation. Lice are most common in children and spread easily from person to person from close contact. They can also be spread by using combs, brushes, bedding, or towels from an infected person. While they're small, you can see white lice eggs, called nits, in the hair around the neck and ears. Nits look like dandruff but stay firmly attached to the hair. Lice are harder to spot unless there are a lot of them. Over-the-counter or prescription shampoos and combing hair with a special nit comb will treat head lice."

      "content": "Some people can have lice and not know it. For others, itching and irritation occur quickly. Usually, the small, white eggs can easily be seen around the neck and ears by parting the hair. Adult lice are harder to spot. Lice can live for up to 40 days on a human but will die in 1 to 2 days if they fall off. Eggs last for 2 weeks, and once they hatch, the cycle can start again. So it's important to treat head lice as soon as it's spotted. Having lice does not mean that a person has poor hygiene or lives in poverty. Lice don't discriminate and will infect any one regardless of social or economic status. Using OTC or prescription shampoos or lotions, removing nits by hand, and cleaning bedding and clothing will cure head lice."

In a rarer form, the episodes result from a problem with how the brain controls breathing.

ACD is likely a protective reaction the body has to the underlying disease. All living cells, including bacteria and even cancer cells, need iron.

It is also possible to have GERD without symptoms of discomfort in your chest.  GERD without symptoms has been linked to causing ear infections, sinus infection, excessive mucus in the throat.

These ear infections are often triggered by allergies, colds, and sinus infections. When the tubes leading from the middle ear to the back of the throat become swollen and blocked, bacteria or viruses can grow. This causes fluid buildup, which puts pressure on the eardrum, causing pain and, sometimes, hearing loss."

If symptoms continue or get worse, the doctor will prescribe antibiotics, usually for 10 days. Even after treatment, fluid may remain in the ear for three to six weeks, causing temporary hearing loss until it is gone.

The dizziness comes from shifts in calcium crystals in the inner ear that normally help the brain know where you are in relation to things around you. Normally, these crystals send signals to the brain that help you balance. But with BPPV the signals are exaggerated. The result is a sensation that either you or the room is spinning. BPPV may be due to labyrinthitis, an inflammation or viral infection in parts of the inner ear. Most often, its cause is unknown. Along with the sensation of spinning, or vertigo, BPPV may cause nausea and sometimes vomiting."

Changing your head position can bring it on or make the symptoms worse. Some people experience the feeling on waking, rolling over, or getting out of bed. During an episode, driving or operating machinery can be dangerous. Often, the BPPV improves on its own with no treatment over a period of a few weeks to a few months. Treating it with medications used for motion sickness can help relieve the symptoms.

High blood pressure often happens with age. Other risk factors are being overweight, having a family history, heavy drinking, lack of exercise, poor diet, and other factors. Primary hypertension often develops over years. Secondary hypertension is caused by an underlying condition such as kidney problems, some medications, and tumors on the adrenal glands. Left untreated, high blood pressure can damage the heart, arteries, and kidneys and greatly increase the risk for stroke and heart attack.
