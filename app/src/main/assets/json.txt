If gloves are not available, use many layers of clean cloth, plastic bags, or the cleanest material available between your hands and the wound.\n\t\t\t\t\t•\tHave the injured person lie down and elevate the site that is bleeding.\n\t\t\t\t\t•\tRemove any visible objects in the wound that are easy to remove, and remove or cut clothing from around the wound.\n\t\t\t\t\t•\tApply steady direct pressure for a full 15 minutes.

          "content": "•\tMedicines that are available fall into two general categories. One category includes medications that are meant to control asthma in the long term and are used daily to prevent asthma attacks (controller medications). These can include inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled cromolyn or nedocromil, long-acting bronchodilators, theophylline, and leukotriene antagonists. The other category is medications that provide instant relief from symptoms (rescue medications). These include short-acting bronchodilators like albuterol. Systemic corticosteroids, like prednisone or methylprednisolone (Medrol), are used for severe persistent symptoms for a short course of treatment, but these medications can take hours, or even days, to become effective. Inhaled ipratropium may be used in addition to inhaled albuterol following asthma attacks or when asthma worsens. It's important to understand the difference between controller and rescue medications and to use them appropriately.\n\n\t\t\t•\tIn general, doctors start with a high level of therapy following an asthma attack and then decrease treatment to the lowest possible level that still prevents asthma attacks and allows your child to have a normal life. Every child needs to follow a customized asthma management plan to control asthma symptoms. The severity of a child's asthma can both worsen and improve over time, so the type (category) of your child's asthma can change, which means different treatment can be required over time. Treatment should be reviewed every 1-6 months, and the choices for long- and short-term therapy are based on how severe the asthma is.\n\n\t\t\t•\tTalk to your doctor about the various medications available to treat asthma."
