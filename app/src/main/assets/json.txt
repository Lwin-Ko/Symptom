If gloves are not available, use many layers of clean cloth, plastic bags, or the cleanest material available between your hands and the wound.\n\t\t\t\t\t•\tHave the injured person lie down and elevate the site that is bleeding.\n\t\t\t\t\t•\tRemove any visible objects in the wound that are easy to remove, and remove or cut clothing from around the wound.\n\t\t\t\t\t•\tApply steady direct pressure for a full 15 minutes.

          "content": "•\tMedicines that are available fall into two general categories. One category includes medications that are meant to control asthma in the long term and are used daily to prevent asthma attacks (controller medications). These can include inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled cromolyn or nedocromil, long-acting bronchodilators, theophylline, and leukotriene antagonists. The other category is medications that provide instant relief from symptoms (rescue medications). These include short-acting bronchodilators like albuterol. Systemic corticosteroids, like prednisone or methylprednisolone (Medrol), are used for severe persistent symptoms for a short course of treatment, but these medications can take hours, or even days, to become effective. Inhaled ipratropium may be used in addition to inhaled albuterol following asthma attacks or when asthma worsens. It's important to understand the difference between controller and rescue medications and to use them appropriately.\n\n\t\t\t•\tIn general, doctors start with a high level of therapy following an asthma attack and then decrease treatment to the lowest possible level that still prevents asthma attacks and allows your child to have a normal life. Every child needs to follow a customized asthma management plan to control asthma symptoms. The severity of a child's asthma can both worsen and improve over time, so the type (category) of your child's asthma can change, which means different treatment can be required over time. Treatment should be reviewed every 1-6 months, and the choices for long- and short-term therapy are based on how severe the asthma is.\n\n\t\t\t•\tTalk to your doctor about the various medications available to treat asthma."

Call your local Poison Control Center or the National Poison Control Hotline (1-800-222-1222) for more information about how to treat the burn.\n\t\t\t•\tTar or hot plastic burns: Immediately run cold water over the hot tar or hot plastic to cool the tar or plastic.\n\t•\tNext, look for other injuries. The burn may not be the only injury.\n\t•\tRemove any jewelry or clothing at the site of the burn. If clothing is stuck to the burn, do not remove it.

Sometimes, it literally causes it to move around in your head. Traumatic brain injuries can cause bruising, damage to the blood vessels, and injury to the nerves.\n\n\tThe result? Your brain doesn't function normally. If you've suffered a concussion, vision may be disturbed, you may lose equilibrium, or you may fall unconscious. In short, the brain is confused.

There are many possible causes for constipation, including:\n\t\t\t•\tWithholding stool. This means that your child is trying to hold his bowel movements in -- maybe because he’s stressed about potty training, maybe because he doesn’t want to use the toilet in certain places (like school), or maybe because he’s afraid of a painful bathroom experience. (Constipation can become a vicious cycle -- if it hurts to “poop” once, the child may be more fearful of going the next time.)\n\t\t\t•\tA diet that’s low in fiber or doesn’t include enough liquids (or both)\n\t\t\t•\tSide effects of certain medications"

          "heading": "Constipation Treatments",
          "content": "\tThere are three primary treatments for most cases of constipation, and they usually work hand-in-hand:\n\t\t\t•\tA stool softener to clear the bowels. These are safe in children, but should be used under the supervision of your pediatrician.\n\n\tTwo common mistakes that parents make when giving their child a stool softener for constipation is not using a large enough dose, or stopping it too soon. For example, you might think that you can stop giving a stool softener after your child’s first normal-looking bowel movement, but stopping too soon may just set your child up for another bout of constipation. Some children may need to stay on a stool softener for a few weeks. Your doctor can advise you on the right dosing schedule for your child.\n\t\t\t•\tA high-fiber diet with plenty of fluids. This means loading your child’s plate with plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, high-fiber cereals, whole grain breads (look for at least 3-5 grams of fiber per serving), and a variety of beans and other legumes, like chickpeas and lentils. Two good sources of fiber that kids are often happy to eat are trail mix (let them make their own) and popcorn with minimal salt or butter. Foods containing probiotics, like yogurt, can also promote good digestive health.\n\n\tWhile focusing on fiber, don’t forget fluids. If your child is eating plenty of high-fiber food but not getting enough fluid to help flush it through his system, you can make matters worse. Your child should be drinking plenty of water throughout the day, along with some milk. Limit sugary drinks to 4 ounces a day in younger children and 6-8 ounces in school-aged kids.\n\t\t\t•\tRegular toilet time. Encourage your child to use the toilet first thing in the morning and after every meal or snack. Particularly for a younger child, you may get better results by telling, not asking. Instead of suggesting, “Do you need to go to the bathroom?” simply say, “Time to go to the bathroom now.”\n\n\tYou’ll get the best results if you combine all three of these approaches. A high-fiber diet isn’t likely to clear up a serious case of constipation on its own without the help of a stool softener; on the other hand, once your child stops taking a stool softener, if he stays on a low-fiber diet and doesn’t get enough healthy fluids, the problem is likely to happen again."

It can also be dangerous -- potentially causing hearing loss, bleeding, infection, even damage to the eardrum.\n\tBabies and young children are known to put small objects in their ears like candy, beans, and rocks, and insects like cockroaches, moths, and flies are also known to crawl into the ears of adults and kids.\n\tRegardless of what’s in the ear, it’s important to get it out as quickly as possible. Here are some important steps to follow:\n\t•\tTry to see if the object will fall out simply by tilting your child’s head.\n\t•\tIf you can see the object in the ear and think you can remove it easily, carefully pull it out with a pair of tweezers. Be careful not to push it in deeper, and don’t poke at the ear or try to remove the object by force. The ear canal is very sensitive, and this could be painful.\n\t•\tIf it is a live insect, kill it before you try to remove it. Put a few drops of warm (not hot) baby oil or vegetable oil in the ear. Have your child tilt and gently shake his head to dislodge the bug. Don't use this method for anything other than an insect, and don't use it if your child is in pain, the ear is bleeding, or if he has tubes in his ear.\n\t•\tIf you’re sure the eardrum isn’t injured and your child doesn’t have tubes in his ear, try washing the object out with a little warm water.\n\n\tYou should see your doctor immediately if you can’t easily get the object out by yourself, or if parts of it remain in the ear. You should also get medical help if there’s pain, hearing loss, or discomfort after the object is removed."
